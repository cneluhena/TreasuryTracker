Treasury Bills and Treasury Bonds Market

Domestic currency debt is mainly raised by the Government of Sri Lanka for budgetary purposes through,

Treasury bills (T bills) which are short-term debt instruments issued under the Local Treasury Bills Ordinance No. 8 of 1923 (as amended) and;

Treasury bonds (T bonds) which are medium to long term debt instruments issued under the Registered Stock and Securities Ordinance No. 7 of 1937 (as amended).

Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL), as the agent of the Government of Sri Lanka is responsible for the issuance of Treasury bills and bonds, and associated debt service payments comprising interest/coupon payments and maturity payments.

Document 8:
Treasury bill market is a segment of the domestic money market. Highly liquid nature of Treasury bills offers investors an alternate source of liquidity whilst generating a return on investment. Therefore, interest rate movements in the Treasury bill market provide a benchmark for the short-term credit market. In addition, changes in the volumes and rates in the Treasury bill market affect the cost, profitability and liquidity of financial institutions.

Document 9:
Treasury bills and bonds are accepted as collateral by the Central Bank under its open market operations. In addition, financial institutions are required to maintain a significant exposure to default risk-free investments to enhance financial stability by the regulator, thus entrenching the importance of Treasury bills and bonds which are considered as default-risk free due to inherent repayment guarantee by the fiscal authority. Treasury bills and bonds are jointly denoted by the term Government securities in day-to-day market terminology.

Main Features of Treasury Bills and Bonds in Sri Lanka

Treasury bills are issued with 91-day, 182-day and 364-day maturities (standard maturities issued at primary auctions) whereas, Treasury bonds are issued for maturities of from 2- 30-years as per the provisions of Local Treasury Bills Ordinance No. 8 of 1923

Treasury bills, normally issued at a discount are repaid at face value at the maturity

Document 10:
Treasury bills, normally issued at a discount are repaid at face value at the maturity

Treasury bonds carry bi-annual coupon payments and are repaid at face value at the maturity.

Treasury bonds can be issued at discount, par or premium

Market determined yield rates prevail

Tradable in the secondary market

Issued in scripless form

A collateral for short-term fund raising

Benefits of Investing in Treasury Bills and Bonds

It is considered as default-risk free, since issued by the sovereign government.

Since T bills and T bonds are tradable in the secondary market, they are highly liquid money market instruments. All receipts of interest and maturity proceeds by foreign investors are fully repatriable.

It is possible to have joint investments.

Under the current law, Government Securities are not subject to withholding tax.

Document 11:

CBSL securely registers these investments in the Central Depository System (CDS), which is connected to an automated Scripless Securities Settlement System (SSSS).

How to invest in Treasury Bills Treasury Bonds

Treasury bills/ bonds can be purchased at any time from the secondary market through primary dealers (PDs) or licensed banks. Primary dealers are appointed by the CBSL to subscribe to issuances of Government securities through the primary market (initial issuance). Other persons who wish to invest in Treasury bills and bonds at the primary market may do so by placing their bids through PDs.

Document 12:
Non-resident investors are permitted to maintain a rupee denominated “Inward Investment Account (IIA)” with a licensed commercial bank in Sri Lanka for their investments in Government securities. Total Treasury bill and bond holdings by non-resident investors in aggregate has been capped at 5 % of the outstanding Treasury bills and bonds separately at any given time.

(more information on IIA can be found via https://www.dfe.lk/web/images/rdevelopment/d8cca82aaa30bb8155cf56a4a8afbffb-2213-35-E.pdf)

A Securities Account in the CDS (the registry) has to be created in the name of the investor/s by the dealer direct participant (licensed bank or SPD) of the CDS. Recording of ownership changes following any transaction in Government securities will take effect on a real time basis depending on the settlement of associated fund transfer.

Document 13:
Interest and maturity proceeds of Treasury bills and bonds are credited to the investor's account through respective dealer direct participant maintaining securities account of the investor on the due date. In the event due date falls on a non-business day, settlement will be postponed to the next business day.

Cultivate an Understanding of Bonds – Beginners Guide

Managing your wealth well is like tending a beautiful formal garden – you need to start with good soil and a good set of tools. Just as good soil has the proper fertility to nourish a plant, having the right foundation in financial literacy should empower you to potentially cultivate a successful investment portfolio. Cultivate an Understanding of Bonds is part of our financial education series to help educate you on the fundamentals of investing as you tend your very own financial garden.

What is a Bond?

If you are looking to build up a well-diversified portfolio, you will usually be advised to include both stocks and bonds among your investments. While stocks may offer you the potential for capital appreciation, bonds may provide a steady stream of investment income, and play an important role of potentially lowering your overall portfolio risks.

Document 18:
A bond is a debt security where the bond issuer (the borrower) issues the bond for purchase by the bondholder (the lender). It is also known as a fixed income security, as a bond usually gives the investor a regular or fixed return.

When you invest in a bond, you are essentially lending a sum of money to the bond issuer. In return, you are usually entitled to receive

interest payments (coupon) at scheduled intervals; and capital repayment of your initial principal amount at an agreed date in the future (maturity date).

Typical bond issuers include:

Sovereign entities

Governments/Government agencies

Banks

Non-bank financial institutions

Corporations

What Types of Bonds are there?

Bonds are differentiated by their varying payment features

Fixed-rate bond

The interest or coupon rate of the bond is fixed for the entire term (tenor) of the bond. If the bond comes with an embedded issuer call option, the bond issuer may prepay the bond at certain pre-determined dates.

Floating-rate bond

Unlike Fixed-rate bonds, the coupon or interest rate of a Floating-rate bond is variable. The interest rate is reset at each coupon payment date, in accordance with a predetermined interest rate index. As in the case for Fixed-rate bonds, issuer call options may also be embedded.

Subordinated bond

Document 20:
Subordinated bond

This type of bond has a lower repayment priority than other bonds issued by the same issuer in the event of the liquidation or bankruptcy of the issuer. A subordinated bond has a lower credit rating because it carries higher risks but pays higher returns than other non-subordinated bonds of the same issuer. These bonds are usually issued by banks.

Convertible bond

These bonds allow the bondholder and/or issuer to convert them into shares of common stocks/shares in the issuing corporation at a pre-determined price in the future when certain conversion criteria are fulfilled. Such bonds are usually issued by companies and tend to pay lower coupon rates than ordinary bonds of the issuer due to the attractiveness of the conversion feature.

TIPS (Treasury Inflation Protected Securities)

These bonds peg their principal amount to the inflation index, therefore protecting the bondholder against inflation. Such bonds are issued by governments.

Zero-coupon bond

Document 21:
These bonds peg their principal amount to the inflation index, therefore protecting the bondholder against inflation. Such bonds are issued by governments.

Zero-coupon bond

Also known as a discount or deep discount bond, this bond is bought at a price lower than its face value, with the face value repaid at the time of maturity. It does not make periodic interest or coupon payments, hence the term zero-coupon bond.

Why Invest in Bonds?

Higher returns than bank deposits Bonds typically pay a higher yield (return) than bank deposits of a similar term (tenor).

Regular income Bond issuers are bound by the terms of the bond to pay out regular coupon income to bondholders (subject to credit risk of the issuer).

Hedge against inflation With proper bond selection, you may potentially earn an investment return which keeps pace with or even exceed the inflation rate.

Document 22:
Hedge against inflation With proper bond selection, you may potentially earn an investment return which keeps pace with or even exceed the inflation rate.

Capital appreciation Like all instruments traded in the secondary market, the price of bonds can appreciate (or depreciate) over and above (or below) the initial purchase price, and allow you to realise capital gains (or capital losses).

What are the Risks?

Credit or Default risk

This is the risk that the bond issuer or borrower is unable to meet the coupon or principal payments on any outstanding bonds or debt (not just the bonds you may be holding) when they fall due (for example, due to bankruptcy or insolvency), and go into default.

Interest rate risk

Interest rates and bond prices are inversely related. Should interest rates rise, the price of your bond will tend to fall (and vice versa). The longer the time to maturity of a bond, the greater the interest rate risk.

Foreign Exchange risk

Document 23:
Foreign Exchange risk

Some bonds are denominated (and the issuer’s payments made) in a foreign currency, which may fluctuate against your home currency. The impact of such foreign exchange movements may offset any interest or capital returns you may receive from the bond investment.

Liquidity risk

This is the risk of having to sell a bond at discounted prices due to the lack of a ready market or buyer. When a bond has a low credit rating (for example, due to the fact that it is part of a small issue or that the issuer’s financial situation is questionable), the liquidity risk will tend to be higher.

Event risk

Events such as leveraged buyouts, mergers, or regulatory changes may adversely affect both (i) the bond issuer’s ability to make payments on the bond, and (ii) the price of the bond.

Sovereign risk

Document 24:
Events such as leveraged buyouts, mergers, or regulatory changes may adversely affect both (i) the bond issuer’s ability to make payments on the bond, and (ii) the price of the bond.

Sovereign risk

Payment of the bond may be affected by the political and economic events in the country of the issuer of the bond. For example, the issuer may be forced to make payments in the local currency of the issuer’s country instead of the original currency of the bond.
